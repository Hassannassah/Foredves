        I imagine you won't ever come here, but if for some reason you do, then I hope you realize...
        This is where I share my thoughts and memories. Sometimes, I feel like a loserâ€”maybe I am a loser in this world for loving too much.
        I probably will never be happy in my life. The only happiest part of my life was with her. Was with you.
        It's not attachment, fuck that. If it was, then I would have been annoying as fuck with you and showed you pathetically how much I want you.
        But instead of doing that, I will take my chances. If you ever see this, i hope you will see it with your eyes, not the world's, who will tag it pathetic and loser.
        It hurts to say that something so pure will be seen as pathetic, but hey, it's the world we made. But I have hope. You are different.
