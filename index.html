        <p>A website for my yearnings i imagine you wont ever come here.but if for some reason you do,then i hope u realize......This is where I share my thoughts and memories.....Sometimes,i feel like a loser,maybe i am a loser in this world for loving too much.i wont prolly be never happy in my life. The only happiest part of my life was with her.Was with you.Its not attachment,fuck that.If it was then i would have been annoying as fuck with u and showed u pathetically how much i want you,but instead of doing that i will take my chances,That if u ever see this u will see it with ur eyes, not the world's who will tag it pathectic and loser.Hurts to say that sm so pure will be seen as pathetic,but hey its the world we made. but i have hope, you are different.</p>
